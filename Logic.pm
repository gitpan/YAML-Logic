=head1 NAME

YAML::Logic - Simple boolean logic in YAML

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use YAML::Syck qw(Load);
    use YAML::Logic;

    my $logic = YAML::Logic->new();

      ### Tests defined somewhere in a YAML file ...
    my $data = Load(q{
      # is $var equal to "foo"?
    rule:
      - $var
      - foo
    });

      ### Tests performed in application code:
    if( $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, 
                          { var => "foo" }) ) {
        print "True!\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

YAML::Logic allows users to define simple boolean logic in a 
configuration file, without permitting them to run arbitrary code.

While Perl code can be controlled with the C<Safe> module, C<Safe> can't 
prevent the user from defining infinite loops, exhausting all available 
memory or crashing the interpreter by exploiting well-known perl bugs.
YAML::Logic isn't perfect in this regard either, but it makes it reasonably 
hard to define harmful code.

The syntax for the boolean logic within a YAML file was inspired by 
John Siracusa's C<Rose::DB::Object::QueryBuilder> module, which provides 
data structures to define logic that is then transformed into SQL. 
YAML::Logic takes the data structure instead and transforms it into Perl
code.

For example, the data structure to check whether a variable C<$var> is
equal to a value "foo", looks like this:

    [$var, "foo"]

It's a reference to an array containing both the value of the variable and
the value to compare it with. In YAML, this looks like

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule: 
      - $var
      - foo

=for test "yaml" end

and this is exactly the syntax that YAML::Logic accepts. Note that after
parsing the YAML configuration above, you need to pass I<only> the 
array ref inside the C<rule> entry to YAML::Logic's C<evaluate()> method:

    $logic->evaluate( $yaml_data->{rule},  ...

Passing the entire YAML data would cause an error with YAML::Logic, as
it expects to receive an array ref.

=head2 Variable Interpolation

Note that variables like C<$var> will be interpolated so that they'll
represent their value before the evaluation starts. 

So if you have

    rule:
      - $var
      - foo

and run

    my $data = YAML::Load( $yaml );
    my $rc = $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, { var => "bar" } );

then YAML::Logic will substitute C<$var> by the string "bar", and then
run the test

    ["bar", "foo"]

which checks if "bar" equals "foo". Since this is false, C<evaluate> 
returns false.

Variable interpolation happens on both sides of the comparison, so comparing

    rule: 
      - $foo
      - $bar

will search for two variables, C<foo> and C<bar>, replace the placeholders
by the variable values and then compare the two entries. 

If a referenced
variable is immediately followed by some text, you can also use Perl's
C<${foo}> notation to reference a variable:

    rule: 
      - ${foo}text
      - $bar

Several comparisons can be combined by lining them up in the array. 
The lineup

    [$var1, "foo", $var2, "bar"]

returns true if $var1 is equal to "foo" I<and> $var2 is equal to "bar".
In YAML::Logic syntax, these two ANDed comparisons are written as

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule: 
      - $var1
      - foo
      - $var2
      - bar

=for test "yaml" end

in a YAML file.

Interpolation is done by the C<Template Toolkit>, so all the magic 
it does for arrays and hashes applies:

    rule:
      - $hash.somekey
      - foo

with

    my $data = YAML::Load( $yaml );
    my $rc = $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, 
                               { hash => { somekey => "foo" } } );

will test if "foo" equals "foo" and hence return a true value. 

Likewise,

    rule:
      - $array.1
      - el2

with

    my $data = YAML::Load( $yaml );
    my $rc = $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, 
                               { array => [ 'el1', 'el2' ] } );

will test if "el2" equals "el2" and return a true value. Check 
C<perldoc Template> or read the O'Reilly Template Toolkit book for a more
detailed explanation of Template's variable interpolation magic.

=head2 Other Comparators

Not only equality can be tested. In addition, these Perl operators are 
supported:

    eq 
    ne 
    lt 
    gt 
    < 
    <=
    > 
    >=
    == 
    !=
    =~ like

The way to specify a different operator C<$op> is to put it as key 
into a hash:

    [ $var, { $op, $value } ]

So, the previous rule comparing $var to "foo" can be written as

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule:
      - $var
      - eq: foo

=for test "yaml" end

which is essentially running 

    $var eq "foo"

in Perl. To perform a numerical comparison, use the C<==> operator,

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule:
      - $var
      - ==: 123

=for test "yaml" end

which runs a test of C<$var == 123> instead.

=head2 Regular Expressions

Regular expression matching is supported as well, so to verify if $var matches
the regular expression C</^foo/>, use

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule:
      - $var
      - like: "^foo"

=for test "yaml" end

or

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule:
      - $var1
      - =~: "^foo"

=for test "yaml" end

Both are equivalent.

Regular expressions are given without delimiters, e.g. if you want to
match against /abc/, simply use

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule:
      - '$var'
      - like: abc

=for test "yaml" end

To add regex modifiers like C</i> or C</ms>, use the C<(?...)> syntax. The
setting

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule:
      - '$var'
      - like: (?i)abc

=for test "yaml" end

will match like C<$var =~ /abc/i>.

=head2 Logical NOT

A logical NOT is expressed by putting an exclamation mark in front of
the variable, so

    ["!$var1", "foo"]

will return true if $var1 is NOT equal to "foo". The YAML notation is

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule: 
      - "!$var1"
      - foo

=for test "yaml" end

for this logical expression. Note that YAML requires putting a string
starting with an exclatmation mark in quotes.

By default, additional rules are chained up with a logical AND operator,
so to check if a variable is not set to "foo" and not set to "bar", use:

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule:
      - '!$var'
      - foo
      - '!$var'
      - bar

=for test "yaml" end

And to verify that the variable matches neither /^foo.*/ nor /^bar.*/, use:

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule:
        - '!$var'
        -
          - like: "^foo.*"
          - like: "^bar.*"

=for test "yaml" end

Also note that "^foo.*" requires quotes in YAML.

=head2 Logical OR

To specify a rule that is satisfied if I<any> of a series of tests
succeeds, use the 'or' keyword in place of a variable:

    [ "or", [ $var, "foo", $var, "bar" ] ]

This data structure indicates that the entire test is supposed to return
true if either C<$var eq "foo"> or C<$var eq "bar"> holds true. It looks
like this in YAML:

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule: 
      - or
      -
        - $var
        - foo
        - $var
        - bar

=for test "yaml" end

Pay close attention to the indentation: After the C<- or> follows a 
line with a dash at the same indentation level, followed by a sub-array
which has its elements indented to the next level.

=head2 Logical AND

By default, YAML::Logic chains up clauses by logical ANDs, i.e.

    rule:
      - $var1
      - foo
      - $var2
      - bar

checks if $var1 is equal to "foo" I<and> $var2 is equal to "bar". 
Alternatively, the "and" keyword can be used similar to the "or"
keyword explained in the previous section:

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule: 
      - and
      -
        - $var
        - foo
        - $var
        - bar

=for test "yaml" end

With the above, you can't have variables named "and" or "or". If you do,
use a hash key, as explained below.

=head2 Defined-ness

The Template Toolkit interpolates undefined variables as empty strings.
But using TT's virtual methods, you can test if a variable is defined
in the template context or not. The YAML logic

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule: 
      - $var1.defined
      - 1

=for test "yaml" end

will return true if C<$var1> has been defined. Conversely, 

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule: 
      - $var1.defined
      - ""

=for test "yaml" end

will return true if the variable C<$var1> is I<not> defined. Note that
defined returns 1 on definedness and the empty string ("") if the variable
is not defined.

=head2 Logical Set Operations

(not yet implemented)

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule: 
      - $var1
      -
        - element1
        - element2

=for test "yaml" end

(not yet implemented)

=for test "yaml" begin

    rule: 
      - $var1
      - like:
          - element1
          - element2

=for test "yaml" end

=head1 YAML Traps

The original YAML implementation has a number of nasty bugs (e.g. RT42015), 
so using YAML::Syck is recommended, which is a both faster and more 
reliable parser.

Also, YAML as a configuration format can be tricky at times. For example 
if you type in

    my $data = Load(q{
      # is $var equal to "foo"?
    rule:
      - $var
      - foo
    });

literally (like in the SYNOPSIS section of this document), keeping the 
indentation intact, YAML will complain that it's not happy about the final 
blank line, which contains whitespace characters:

    Code: YAML_PARSE_ERR_NO_FINAL_NEWLINE

To avoid this, either use a YAML file, in which not using unnecessary
indentation will feel natural. When using YAML strings, make sure there's 
no last line containing just whitespace, before feeding it to the 
YAML parser:

    my $yaml_string = q{
          # is $var equal to "foo"?
        rule:
          - $var
          - foo
    };
    $yaml_string =~ s/^\s+\Z//m;
    my $data = Load($yaml_string);

Also, certain characters have a special meaning in YAML, so you can't write

    # WRONG
    rule:
      - $var
      - !blah!

because YAML will parse that to

    [$var, undef]

within the C<rule> hash entry. Why?
Lines starting with an exclamation mark are I<tags> in YAML. To 
avoid getting tripped up by this, use quotes:

    # CORRECT
    rule:
      - $var
      - "!blah!"

which correctly parses to 

    [$var, "!blah!"]

within the C<rule> hash entry instead.

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

If a rule fails, the error() method can be used to obtain a detailed
textual description on why a comparison or a regex match failed.

    if( $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, 
                          { var => "foo" }) ) {
        print "True!\n";
    } else {
        print "Failed, reason is: ", $logic->error();
    }

This will print something like

    Failed, reason is: Test ["foo" eq "bar"] returned []

saying the when it compared "foo" to "bar", the result was the empty
string (Perl's idea of 'false').

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

=over 4

=item B<Error Message: Unknown type: HASH(0x857d51c) at YAML/Logic.pm>

This means that you've fed a hash to YAML::Logic. For example, if your
YAML file says 

    rule:
      - "foo"
      - "bar"

you've probably read the YAML file like

    my $data = LoadFile( $file );

and now the data looks like 

    { rule => ["foo", "bar"] }

which, when you feed it unmodified to YAML::Logic as in

    $logic->evaluate( $data );

presents the "rule" field to YAML::Logic, which it doesn't understand. 
Pass the content of the rule to YAML::Logic instead:

    $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule} );

and it will work as expected.
